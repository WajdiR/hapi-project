Note-Taking API
This project implements a RESTful API service for a simple note-taking application using TypeScript and the hapi.dev framework.

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

Node.js
npm (Node Package Manager)
Installing
A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

Clone the Repository

sh
Copy code
git clone [repository URL]
Navigate to the project directory

sh
Copy code
cd note-taking-app
Install Dependencies

sh
Copy code
npm install
Start the Server

sh
Copy code
npm start
The server should start on localhost with the default port 3000.

Running the Tests
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system:

sh
Copy code
npm test
API Endpoints
Briefly describe each API endpoint:

POST /notes: Create a new note.
GET /notes: Retrieve all notes.
GET /notes/{id}: Retrieve a note by its ID.
PUT /notes/{id}: Update a note by its ID.
DELETE /notes/{id}: Delete a note by its ID.
Project Structure
As the project grows in complexity, consider the following structure:

Modularization: Keep the codebase modular. Each component (e.g., validation, controllers, services) should have its own directory and purpose.
Database Integration: Replace the in-memory array with a proper database. Integrate a database solution like MongoDB or PostgreSQL and use an ORM for database interactions.
Authentication: Implement user authentication and authorization for secure access to the notes.
Caching: For frequently accessed data, implement caching mechanisms to improve performance.
Error Logging: Integrate a robust error logging system for easier debugging and monitoring.
Environment Configuration: Use environment variables or configuration files for different environments (development, test, production).
API Documentation: Use tools like Swagger to document the API endpoints, making it easier for other developers to understand and use your API.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
Built With
Node.js - The JavaScript runtime
hapi.dev - The server framework
